Creating a comprehensive README is crucial for guiding users through setting up and testing your stack, which includes a Node.js API, a Python worker, RabbitMQ for messaging, Jaeger for tracing, and Logstash with ELK for logging. Below is a sample README in markdown format that outlines the necessary steps.

# Full Stack Application with Node.js, Python, RabbitMQ, Jaeger, and ELK

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and test a full-stack application environment using Docker Compose. The stack includes a Node.js API, a Python worker for processing tasks, RabbitMQ as a message broker, Jaeger for distributed tracing, and the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Docker, Node.js, Python, and Docker Compose.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started. Ensure you have access to the Dockerfiles and the `docker-compose.yml` for the setup.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 2: Build and Run with Docker Compose

Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command to build and start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds the images for the Node.js API, Python worker, and sets up RabbitMQ, Jaeger, and the ELK stack.

### Step 3: Verify Services are Running

Ensure all services are up and running by checking the output of the Docker Compose command. You should see logs from each service indicating they have started successfully.

## Testing

### Testing the Node.js API

1. **Send a Request to the API**: Use `curl` or Postman to send a request to the Node.js API.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

```bash
python3 exercise-api.py
```

You should receive a response from the API, such as "Hello Mathpix! from Node.js API with Jaeger Tracing!"

### Monitoring with Jaeger

1. **Access Jaeger UI**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:16686` to access the Jaeger UI.
2. **Find Traces**: Use the Jaeger UI to find and inspect traces generated by requests to the Node.js API.

### Log Monitoring with ELK

1. **Access Kibana UI**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5601` in a web browser to access Kibana.
2. **Configure Index Pattern**: Set up an index pattern in Kibana to explore the logs stored in Elasticsearch.
3. **View Logs**: Use Kibana's Discover feature to view and analyze logs generated by the services.

### Testing with the Python Worker

1. **Send Messages to RabbitMQ**: Depending on your Python worker's implementation, you may need to send messages or tasks to RabbitMQ for the worker to process.
2. **Monitor Worker Logs and Traces**: Check the Docker Compose logs for output from the Python worker and use Jaeger to trace any interactions or tasks processed by the worker.

## Troubleshooting

- **Service Not Starting**: Check the Docker Compose logs for errors. Ensure all service dependencies are correctly defined.
- **Jaeger Tracing Not Appearing**: Verify that the Jaeger client in your services is correctly configured with the Jaeger agent's host and port.
- **Logs Not Showing in Kibana**: Ensure Logstash is correctly configured to process and forward logs to Elasticsearch. Check your Logstash pipeline configuration.

## Conclusion

This guide covers the basic setup and testing of a full-stack application environment with Node.js, Python, RabbitMQ, Jaeger, and the ELK stack using Docker Compose. For more detailed information on each component, refer to the official documentation of the respective technologies.
